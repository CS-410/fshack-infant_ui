					<h1>About Infant FS Hack</h1>
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						While there exists brain analysis tools for adults, the
						development of equivalent tools for infant brains are
						lagging behind. The Infant FreeSurfer plugin, unlike the
						standard FreeSurfer plugin, will allow researchers and
						clinical workers to process and analyze infant brain
						images to produce characteristic information about the
						brains, such as volume, thickness, surface area, and
						curvature. Developers can also choose to generate their
						own workflow through a shell script that would run on a
						local instance of ChRIS' back-end (CUBE).
					</p>
					<h2>Usage</h2>
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Get the back-end of ChRIS running (further
								instructions
								<a href="http://chrisproject.org/join-us/get-chris-running">
									{" "}
									here
								</a>
								)
							</li>
							<li>
								If you haven't already, log into the ChRIS
								back-end through our login screen
							</li>
							<li>
								Click the <b> Upload .NII or .DCM dataset </b>
								button to upload a brain image
							</li>
							<li>
								Afterwards, you can view the newly created feed
								for the uploaded file as well as pre-existing
								feeds associated to your CUBE account
							</li>
						</ol>
